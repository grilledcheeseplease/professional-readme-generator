# Professional README Generator

## Description

Check out my professional README generator! Once the command line ==node index.js== is entered into the terminal and while in the proper directory, you will be prompted with a series of questions designed to create your README.md document. Along with questions to gather your contact information and fill in the blanks on the README, you will be asked to pick a license that will appear on your README once completed. 

I am so excited to share this with you as I have worked very hard to grasp all the concepts I have been introduced to thus far. So please try it out and let me know if you have any feedback. Happy coding!
